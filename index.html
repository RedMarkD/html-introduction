<h2> You can always count on me to ... </h2>
Commit fully to a project once I've set my mind to it.
However, it'll take some time to do so as I don't like to let people down, and am also wary of making commitments or promises I can't keep.
To be honest I take promises and commitments very seriously.
<h2> A funny story </h2>

<h3> TL;DR:  </h3>
<p> Calm, cool, collected </p>
